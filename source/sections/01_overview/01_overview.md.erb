# Overview

The Cryptomood API provides you real-time or historic data of market sentiment, or simple processed entries.
Currently we are providing means to access realtime news and realtime sentiment analysis output via websockets (PUB-SUB schema).
Historical data are provided via classic json api.

All messages are always json-encoded wrappers. Unmarshalled, they have the following structure:

#### Realtime messages

Key | Type | Description
--------- | ----------- | -----------
`kind` | string | message type
`item` | <T> | the actual payload

#### Historic data

Key | Type | Description
--------- | ----------- | -----------
`from` | string | start timestamp of the data window
`to` | object | end timestamp of the data window
`kind` | object | data type
`items` | []<T> | list of items for current request type

We are using the `kind` field for data identification in all messages.
