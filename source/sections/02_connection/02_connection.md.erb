# Connection

We provide api data via websockets.
For the most part, in the events we are using ‘news’ and ‘social’ prefixes/suffixes to distinguish between two main categories.
The latter is divided into subcategories, mostly because of different message types.
These subcategories are then named after specific social network - ‘twitter’, ‘reddit’, ‘bitmex’, ‘discord’, ‘telegram’.

Each connection should be using provided api key, be it currently available websocket api or request-response based json api,
which is intended for the future.

### Connection string

> Connection via native websocket implementation 

```javascript
var apiKey="0123456789"; // use your own key
var wsConnection = new WebSocket('wss://api.cryptomood.com?apiKey=' + apiKey);
```

> After the successful connection you can use subscribtions as stated in sections below

```javascript
var eventName="eventName"
wsConnection.addEventListener('message', function (event) {
    var parsed = JSON.parse(event.data)
    if (parsed.subject === eventName) {
      console.log(parsed.data)
    }
});
```

`<protocol>://api.cryptomood.com:<port>/?apiKey=<apiKey>`
